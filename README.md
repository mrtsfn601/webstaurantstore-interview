# WebstaurantStore Code Screen Task

## Author's Notes

This project demonstrates the author's ability to develop a Maven-based test automation mini-framework using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG. The implementation includes, but is not limited to, the following concepts:

* Java design patterns: Singleton, Builder
* Java object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, interface, abstraction, polymorphism
* Selenium Page Object Model, fluent waits, and Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

This is not the final version; there are always opportunities for improvement and refactoring. The implementation took two short but joyful evenings, accompanied by coding vibe music and a cup of coffee. ðŸŽµâ˜•

Additionally, the below requirement states, _'Check the search result ensuring every product has the word "Table" in its title.'_ However, this is not the case for the item _'metro cr2430dss drive-thru order prep station with stainless steel shelving - 31 3/4" x 27 3/4" x 65 3/4"'_, and the test fails earlier due to an unexpected issue (see the screenshot below). In the code, the author made a tweak to demonstrate that the test is runnable from end to end (see `SearchResultPage#assertItemsOnTheCurrentPageContain`).
